	* improve thresholding to find local minimum for ithresh
          (helps with t2 images)

2008-02-21  Claude Lepage      <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* improve thresholding when background is very noisy 
          and bg and csf merge together
	* add special case for t2/pd (with reversed intensities)
          for better and complete expansion of the surface

2007-08-22  Claude Lepage      <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* disable inward progression of surface mask inside
	  large ventricles (e.g. Alzheimer) to avoid inverted
          mask
	* optimize the threshold for background/csf when the
          background image is very noisy

2007-05-17  Claude Lepage      <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
        * recalculation of center of mass for tall neck
        * better approach to compute the thresholds from the
          histogram

2006-12-19  Claude Lepage      <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* add max switch for bright meninges in t1 images
	* sample image in normal direction at half voxel size

2006-10-20  Claude Lepage      <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* copy all attributes of minc header from source image
          to output mask (to include direction cosines too!)
	* save the mask with the axes in the same order as in
          the source image
	* save mask in byte format

2006-08-15  Claude Lepage      <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* properly account for voxel sizes when not 1.0mm.
        * use local edge length in local radius of curvature 
          instead of a global average edge length
	* output surface mask in obj format

2006-05-26  Claude Lepage      <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* increased tesselation order to 6 for more accuracy
