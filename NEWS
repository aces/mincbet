New in Release 1.3.2
--------------------
        * improve thresholding when background is very noisy
          and bg and csf merge together
        * add special case for t2/pd (with reversed intensities)
          for better and complete expansion of the surface

New in Release 1.3.1
--------------------
        * disable inward progression of surface mask inside
          large ventricles (e.g. Alzheimer) to avoid inverted
          mask
        * optimize the threshold for background/csf when the
          background image is very noisy

New in Release 1.3.0
--------------------
        * recalculation of center of mass for tall neck
        * better approach to compute the thresholds from the 
          histogram

New in Release 1.2.2
--------------------
        * add max switch for bright meninges in t1 images
        * sample image in normal direction at half voxel size

New in Release 1.2.1
--------------------
        * copy all attributes of minc header from source image
          to output mask (to include direction cosines too!)
        * save the mask with the axes in the same order as in
          the source image
        * save mask in byte format

New in Release 1.2.0
--------------------
        * properly account for voxel sizes when not 1.0mm.
        * use local edge length in local radius of curvature
          instead of a global average edge length
	* output surface mask in obj format

New in Release 1.1
------------------
	* increased tesselation order

New in Release 1.0
------------------
	* fully autoconfiscated
