2006-12-19  Claude Lepage      <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* add max switch for bright meninges in t1 images
	* sample image in normal direction at half voxel size

2006-10-20  Claude Lepage      <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* copy all attributes of minc header from source image
          to output mask (to include direction cosines too!)
	* save the mask with the axes in the same order as in
          the source image
	* save mask in byte format

2006-08-15  Claude Lepage      <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* properly account for voxel sizes when not 1.0mm.
        * use local edge length in local radius of curvature 
          instead of a global average edge length
	* output surface mask in obj format

2006-05-26  Claude Lepage      <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* increased tesselation order to 6 for more accuracy

2006-03-10  Claude Lepage      <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* fixed Makefile.am to add scripts to distribution;
	* fixed xINCDIRx and xPERLx inside scripts 
	* fixed configure.ac to create scripts (replace .plib
          by .pl.in to produce .pl)

2006-03-01  Claude Lepage      <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
        * surface_qc.pl: new file, for surface quality checks
        * cortical_thickness.pl: new file, for easy calculation
          of cortical thickness using tlink, tnear, tnormal,
          tlaplace
        * most scripts: allow 328K surfaces, add mincdefrag,
          more iterations and use linear weights for gray
          expansion, remove a white matter masking step that
          was chopping the left occipital lobe, etc.
        * evaluate_fit_3d.c (functions evaluate_laplacian_fit
          and evaluate_laplacian_fit_deriv): add oversampling,
          remove check on tissue type in derivative, clean-up
          calculation of derivative, print residual to measure
          convergence.

2005-11-01  Andrew Janke  <a.janke@gmail.com>

	* renamed to surface-extraction for release
	* renamed new_fit_3D to surface_fit
	
2004-10-17  Jason Lerch	      <jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* calibrate_white.pl: fixed divide by zero bug on linux
	
2004-10-16  Jason Lerch	      <jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* configure.ac: changed name to CLASP and bumped up to version 2.0
	* scripts/Makefile.am: added classify_correct to installable
	scripts
	* fixed header inclusions
	* changed datadir references in scripts to CLASP from ASP

2004-04-30  June Sic Kim      <luck3d@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* delete some redundant code in 'evaluate_laplacian_fit' & 
        'evaluate_volume_fit'
        * fixed include statement in fit_3d.h
	* scripts/expand_from_white: add gradient file of laplacian map.

2003-09-10  Jason Lerch	      <jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* added src/skeletonization.{c,h} to the repository

2003-09-08  Jason Lerch       <jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* added scripts/make_asp_grid.pl
	* fixed include statement in fit_3d.h

2002-08-09  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* scripts/Makefile.am:
	* scripts/asp.pl: Set MNI_DATAPATH, if not already in 
	environment.

	* scripts/mask_cortical_white_matter.pl: Substitute
	perl path.

2002-08-01  Jason Lerch		<jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* correct header inclusion

2002-04-08  Jason Lerch		<jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* NEWS added.
	* removed specific bicpl header checks from configure.ac
	* added bicpl/ or volume_io/ into #include statements where
	necessary.
	
2002-01-20  Jason Lerch		<jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* tagged the repository with the rag "rel_1" - this is the
	software as David MacDonald had left it (with only very minor
	bug-fixes).
